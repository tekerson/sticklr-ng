# Sticklr

## What does it do?

It's a virtual photo collage.
It allows the selection of a "photo" and the building of a "sticker" library, by reading files from your local machine using the `FileReader` browser API.
The stickers can then dragged from the library onto the photo, using the HTML5 drag and drop API, to create a collage.

## What is it?

Sometimes the basics of an application can get lost in the experimentation with new techinques and technologies. This is an attempt to write a more "vanilla" Angular application than some of the experiments I have been playing with. It should be complex enough to provide an example of some design decisions without doing anything too controversial or unusual.
